You'll learn about Gatsby plugins and creating "layout" components.

Gatsby plugins are JavaScript packages that help add functionality to a Gatsby site.
These plugins are able to extend and modify just about everything Gatsby does.

Layout components are for sections of your site that you want to share across multiple pages.
For example, sites will commonly have a layout component with a shared header and footer.
Other common things to add to layouts are a sidebar and/or navigation menu.
On this page for example, the header at the top is part of gatsbyjs.com's component.
